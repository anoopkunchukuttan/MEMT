This automates installation of packages from source into a prefix directory.  
Command line is ./install.sh /some/prefix/directory "list of packages in order" -jparallelism where parallelism is the number of processors to use.
You probably want to set the environment variables CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to something efficient.  See http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Safe_Cflags for guidance.  

Once installed, you can run either
source /some/prefix/directory/environment.bash
or
source /some/prefix/directory/environment.tcsh
depending on your shell to setup the environment to use the installed packages.  

For MEMT's dependencies, run ./install.sh /some/prefix/directory "icu boost ruby" -jparallelism

Dependencies:
MEMT decoder source code (provided in memt.tar.gz) -> icu boost
MEMT tuning scripts (provided in memt.tar.gz) -> ruby
boost -> icu

Note that there is no separate make and make install as some packages' make depends on other packages' make install, so there would be several iterations.
